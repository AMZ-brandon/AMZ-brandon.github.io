# Introduction

Welcome to *The Cedar Authorization Policy Language*, an introductory book about Cedar.

Cedar is an open-source *authorization policy language*.
Using Cedar, developers can write policies that specify fine-grained permissions for their applications.
The applications then authorize access requests by calling Cedarâ€™s authorization engine.
Cedar was designed from the ground up to balance several competing goals: It is *expressive*, so that application developers can grant access based on user and resource attributes, group membership, and session context; *performant*, so that access requests are decided quickly; *safe*, so that policy authoring mistakes are caught or avoided; and *analyzable*, so that policy analysis tools can reason precisely about important access invariants.
Because Cedar's syntax is designed specifically for authorization, its policies are easy to understand.
Because Cedar policies are separate from application code, they can be authored, updated, analyzed, and audited independently of the application code.
